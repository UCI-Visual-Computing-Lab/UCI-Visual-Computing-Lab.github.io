	abstract = {Photorealistic simulation plays a crucial role in applications such as autonomous driving, where advances in neural radiance fields (NeRFs) may allow better scalability through the automatic creation of digital 3D assets. However, reconstruction quality suffers on street scenes due to largely collinear camera motions and sparser samplings at higher speeds. On the other hand, the application often demands rendering from camera views that deviate from the inputs to accurately simulate behaviors like lane changes. In this paper, we propose several insights that allow a better utilization of Lidar data to improve NeRF quality on street scenes. First, our framework learns a geometric scene representation from Lidar, which is fused with the implicit grid-based representation for radiance decoding, thereby supplying stronger geometric information offered by explicit point cloud. Second, we put forth a robust occlusion-aware depth supervision scheme, which allows utilizing densified Lidar points by accumulation. Third, we generate augmented training views from Lidar points for further improvement. Our insights translate to largely improved novel view synthesis under real driving scenes.},

	abstract = {This study introduces a novel On-the-Fly Guidance (OFG) training framework for enhancing existing learning-based image registration models, addressing the limitations of weakly-supervised and unsupervised methods. Weakly-supervised methods struggle due to the scarcity of labeled data, and unsupervised methods directly depend on image similarity metrics for accuracy. Our method proposes a supervised fashion for training registration models, without the need for any labeled data. OFG generates pseudo-ground truth during training by refining deformation predictions with a differentiable optimizer, enabling direct supervised learning. OFG optimizes deformation predictions efficiently, improving the performance of registration models without sacrificing inference speed. Our method is tested across several benchmark datasets and leading models, it significantly enhanced performance, providing a plug-and-play solution for training learning-based registration models.

Of course, both paradigms offer advantages and disadvantages, and, in this work, we seek to combine their respective strengths into a single streamlined framework, using the outputs of the learning based method as initial parameters for optimization while prioritizing computational power for the image pairs that offer the greatest loss. Our investigations showed improvements of up to 1.6\% in test data, while maintaining the same inference time, and a substantial 1.0\% points performance gain in deformation field smoothness.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17555},
	abstract = {Mesh deformation plays a pivotal role in many 3D vision tasks including dynamic simulations, rendering, and reconstruction. However, defining an efficient discrepancy between predicted and target meshes remains an open problem. A prevalent approach in current deep learning is the set-based approach which measures the discrepancy between two surfaces by comparing two randomly sampled point-clouds from the two meshes with Chamfer pseudo-distance. Nevertheless, the set-based approach still has limitations such as lacking a theoretical guarantee for choosing the number of points in sampled point-clouds, and the pseudo-metricity and the quadratic complexity of the Chamfer divergence. To address these issues, we propose a novel metric for learning mesh deformation. The metric is defined by sliced Wasserstein distance on meshes represented as probability measures that generalize the set-based approach. By leveraging probability measure space, we gain flexibility in encoding meshes using diverse forms of probability measures, such as continuous, empirical, and discrete measures via varifold representation. After having encoded probability measures, we can compare meshes by using the sliced Wasserstein distance which is an effective optimal transport distance with linear computational complexity and can provide a fast statistical rate for approximating the surface of meshes. To the end, we employ a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) to deform the input surface into the target shape by modeling the trajectories of the points on the surface. Our experiments on cortical surface reconstruction demonstrate that our approach surpasses other competing methods in multiple datasets and metrics.},

Specifically, Hybrid-CSR begins with explicit deformations of template meshes to obtain coarsely reconstructed cortical surfaces, based on which the oriented point clouds are estimated for the subsequent differentiable poisson surface reconstruction. By doing so, our method unifies explicit (oriented point clouds) and implicit (indicator function) cortical surface reconstruction. Compared to explicit representation-based methods, our hybrid approach is more friendly to capture detailed structures, and when compared with implicit representation-based methods, our method can be topology aware because of end-to-end training with a mesh-based deformation module. In order to address topology defects, we propose a new topology correction pipeline that relies on optimization-based diffeomorphic surface registration. Experimental results on three brain datasets show that our approach surpasses existing implicit and explicit cortical surface reconstruction methods in numeric metrics in terms of accuracy, regularity, and consistency.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) exhibit reduced expression in skeletal muscle of diabetic and prediabetic humans. Moreover, these changes may be mediated by the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α). By combining PGC-1α-induced genome-wide transcriptional profiles with a computational strategy to detect cis-regulatory motifs, we identified estrogen-related receptor α (Errα) and GA repeat-binding protein α as key transcription factors regulating the OXPHOS pathway. Interestingly, the genes encoding these two transcription factors are themselves PGC-1α-inducible and contain variants of both motifs near their promoters. Cellular assays confirmed that Errα and GA-binding protein a partner with PGC-1α in muscle to form a double-positive-feedback loop that drives the expression of many OXPHOS genes. By using a synthetic inhibitor of Errα, we demonstrated its key role in PGC-1α-mediated effects on gene regulation and cellular respiration. These results illustrate the dissection of gene regulatory networks in a complex mammalian system, elucidate the mechanism of PGC-1α action in the OXPHOS pathway, and suggest that Errα agonists may ameliorate insulin-resistance in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus.},

	abstract = {Although the Human Genome Project was completed 4 years ago, the catalog of human protein-coding genes remains a matter of controversy. Current catalogs list a total of ≈24,500 putative protein-coding genes. It is broadly suspected that a large fraction of these entries are functionally meaningless ORFs present by chance in RNA transcripts, because they show no evidence of evolutionary conservation with mouse or dog. However, there is currently no scientific justification for excluding ORFs simply because they fail to show evolutionary conservation: the alternative hypothesis is that most of these ORFs are actually valid human genes that reflect gene innovation in the primate lineage or gene loss in the other lineages. Here, we reject this hypothesis by carefully analyzing the nonconserved ORFs—specifically, their properties in other primates. We show that the vast majority of these ORFs are random occurrences. The analysis yields, as a by-product, a major revision of the current human catalogs, cutting the number of protein-coding genes to ≈20,500. Specifically, it suggests that nonconserved ORFs should be added to the human gene catalog only if there is clear evidence of an encoded protein. It also provides a principled methodology for evaluating future proposed additions to the human gene catalog. Finally, the results indicate that there has been relatively little true innovation in mammalian protein-coding genes.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              Radiation therapy (RT) is a common treatment option for head and neck (HaN) cancer. An important step involved in RT planning is the delineation of organs‐at‐risks (OARs) based on HaN computed tomography (CT). However, manually delineating OARs is time‐consuming as each slice of CT images needs to be individually examined and a typical CT consists of hundreds of slices. Automating OARs segmentation has the benefit of both reducing the time and improving the quality of RT planning. Existing anatomy autosegmentation algorithms use primarily atlas‐based methods, which require sophisticated atlas creation and cannot adequately account for anatomy variations among patients. In this work, we propose an end‐to‐end, atlas‐free three‐dimensional (3D) convolutional deep learning framework for fast and fully automated whole‐volume HaN anatomy segmentation.
            
            
              Methods
              Our deep learning model, called AnatomyNet, segments OARs from head and neck CT images in an end‐to‐end fashion, receiving whole‐volume HaN CT images as input and generating masks of all OARs of interest in one shot. AnatomyNet is built upon the popular 3D U‐net architecture, but extends it in three important ways: (a) a new encoding scheme to allow autosegmentation on whole‐volume CT images instead of local patches or subsets of slices, (b) incorporating 3D squeeze‐and‐excitation residual blocks in encoding layers for better feature representation, and (c) a new loss function combining Dice scores and focal loss to facilitate the training of the neural model. These features are designed to address two main challenges in deep learning‐based HaN segmentation: (a) segmenting small anatomies (i.e., optic chiasm and optic nerves) occupying only a few slices, and (b) training with inconsistent data annotations with missing ground truth for some anatomical structures.
            
            
              Results
              We collected 261 HaN CT images to train AnatomyNet and used MICCAI Head and Neck Auto Segmentation Challenge 2015 as a benchmark dataset to evaluate the performance of AnatomyNet. The objective is to segment nine anatomies: brain stem, chiasm, mandible, optic nerve left, optic nerve right, parotid gland left, parotid gland right, submandibular gland left, and submandibular gland right. Compared to previous state‐of‐the‐art results from the MICCAI 2015 competition, AnatomyNet increases Dice similarity coefficient by 3.3\% on average. AnatomyNet takes about 0.12 s to fully segment a head and neck CT image of dimension 178 × 302 × 225, significantly faster than previous methods. In addition, the model is able to process whole‐volume CT images and delineate all OARs in one pass, requiring little pre‐ or postprocessing.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Deep learning models offer a feasible solution to the problem of delineating OARs from CT images. We demonstrate that our proposed model can improve segmentation accuracy and simplify the autosegmentation pipeline. With this method, it is possible to delineate OARs of a head and neck CT within a fraction of a second.},
